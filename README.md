# music-bot-template

A music bot template using [interactions-py](https://github.com/interactions-py/interactions.py) and [interactions-lavalink](https://pypi.org/project/interactions-lavalink/).

### INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Install Python 3.11.x and PIP
2. Download all respository files. I recommend using Github Desktop and cloning everything.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all bot requirements. If you're putting this in a hosting service this will most likely do this step by itself.
4. Fill out **config.yaml** and make sure to uncomment it from **.gitignore**. Please note you are required to get Lavalink server information and Spotify API keys and secrets.
5. Run main.py and enjoy the music.
